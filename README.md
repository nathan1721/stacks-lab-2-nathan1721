Lab Description :   Read in a group of symbols and check to see if the appropriate opening symbol correctly matches up with the appropriate closing symbol.  
The opening symbols are “{(<[“ and the appropriate closing symbols are “})>]“.

You must read in and analyze each group.  

If you were to read in {[]}, you would have a correct balance of opening and closing symbols.
If you were to read in {[}], you would not have a correct balance of opening and closing symbols.



Sample Data : 
(abc(*def) 
[{}]
[
[{<()>}]
{<html[value=4]*(12)>{$x}}
[one]<two>{three}(four)
car(cdr(a)(b)))
car(cdr(a)(b))

[{<()>}] is correct.

{<html[value=4]*(12)>{$x}} is correct.

[one]<two>{three}(four) is correct.
